My name is Vishnu Narang. I'm an Indian living in Pune, having passion for technology and adventure sports. Soccer, biking and driving cars come next in the list.
I write code for a living. I have been working at [ThoughtWorks Inc][Thoughtworks] (Pune Office) right after graduation from *Pune Institute of Computer Technology*.

Lately **Internet of Things** has sparked a deep interest. Learning more about it technically.
